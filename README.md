# JWT_Token_Authentication
JWT (JSON Web Token) Token Authentication is a method used in web applications and APIs to authenticate users and authorize access to protected resources. It relies on the use of digitally signed tokens to securely transmit information between parties, typically between a client (such as a web browser or mobile app) and a server.
